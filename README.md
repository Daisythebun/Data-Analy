# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}
#This dataset has customers and their credit card info along with other items such as thier credit limit.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}
#I am writing this software to give the user the ability to sort the data in few different catagories and allows the user to find the averages of different catagories

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

{List the questions and the answers you found by doing this analysis.}
Question 1 - What is the average customer age?
Question 2 - Who has the most and the least credit limit?

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
#The tools i used this this were python, pandas, anaconda, and yupyter labs.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
# I used python
#yupyter labs with a statistics library
# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1 could add an image to appear as an answer
* Item 2 Could learn how to sort columns or rows with werid images
* Item 3 feel like there is away to make this code smaller because i used alot of loops and if statements
